Raspberry : 
	server :
		fetch and push data to the database -> add_data.py
		get datas from database and push them to the server so he prints them -> server.py
		displays and stuff for the server -> templates/.html and.css files

Arduino :
	collect data and send them through wireless network -> send_datas.ino

Miscellaneous :
	database config and storage, probably possible to scratch this out and do everything on the server



add_data.py :
	fetch data from wireless network -> TODO
	push data to db -> DONE

server.py : 
	get datas from db -> DONE
	push them to the server -> DONE

send_datas.ino :
	collect data -> DONE
	send them through wireless network -> TODO

Miscellaneous :
	database config -> WiP, temporary version DONE
	refactor everything so the config is transparent -> TODO
